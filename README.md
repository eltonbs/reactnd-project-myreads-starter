# MyReads Project

Project for Udacity's React Nanodegree. 

This is an application for managing books. You can organize the books into categories: Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read. 

This application uses an Udacity API that provides the books information (reactnd-books-api.udacity.com/).

## Run Project

* open terminal and go to project folder
* install project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* access http://localhost:3000

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
